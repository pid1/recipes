Highly regional, this is a western Carolina hill country BBQ sauce. Very vinegar forward, it helps cut through the richness of a fatty brisket. Works great as a mop sauce.

## White Gravy

Great on biscuits, fried chicken, or mashed potatoes. Sarah doesn't eat pork, so we use butter as the fat here instead of lard.

Makes about 3 cups

**Ingredients**
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

**Instructions**

1. Melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and whisk continuously until the mixture has a toasty aroma and becomes a deep golden hue, 3 to 5 minutes. (The roux will thin out a bit as it continues to cook.)
2. Whisking constantly, slowly add 2 cups milk a 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture will seize up at first. Don’t worry, just keep slowly adding the milk and whisking constantly — it will become smooth and creamy. Add 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and whisk to combine.
3. Continue to whisk and cook until the gravy is thickened to your desired consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. It should fall in a thick stream from a spoon, but not clump. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed.
